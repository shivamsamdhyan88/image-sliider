In this web development project, I have create an image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. An image slider is a common component used to display a series of images in a visually appealing way.
This website project is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
It also have a  automatically transition to the next image after a certain interval (e.g., every 3 seconds).
It always display the first image when the page loads.
Allow users to click on navigation buttons i.e. "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate through the images.
Loop back to the first image after reaching the last one.
I also included a video as a background so the website looks cool and different.
I also inculded a animation using 'clip-path' css property in automatic and manual transition.
